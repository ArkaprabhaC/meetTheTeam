# meetTheTeam
A basic layout of a typical "meet-the-team" page of any startup without the use of JS.
Fully responsive to given width settings for both mobile and tablet

To expand the content to make room new people, just copy and paste these lines-
            <div class="one-third" id="name-2">
                 <img class="display" src="Images/Filler.png" width="250px" height="250px">
                 <h1>Lorem Ipsium</h1>
                 <p>Lorem Ipsium</p>
            </div>
and make the changes necessary. 

Also, change the width of #name-7 in tablet mode from 100% to 50% so as to layout the new elements perfectly.
